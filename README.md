# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
I was given the task of doing an Election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections for a local congressional race.

### Audit Process Overview
1. Determined total vote count for the congressional race.
2. Determined the list of candidates in the race. 
3. Computed the total votes received per candidate.
4. Calculated what percentage of votes each candidate received. 
5. Deduced the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code

## Summary
In iterating through all of the data in the election_results.csv, this are my conclusions. 

The total vote count for this election was 369,711 votes cast. 

There were three total candidates in this race.
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane

The breakdown of the vote counts are as follows. 
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 total votes with 3.1% of the total vote count. 
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 total votes with 23.0% of the total vote count. 
  - Diana DeGette received 272,892 total votes with 73.8% of the total vote count. 

The winner for the election, by a landslide was Diana DeGette receiving the highest number of votes and highest percentage of votes.
